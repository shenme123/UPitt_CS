I'm doing the 100% version. The command line arguments can take:
dir name
(e.g., java Project5), 

dir name and regex of file type 
(e.g., java Project5  dir1 .*\.java), 

or dir name plus regex of file type and regex that is to be searched from file content 
(e.g., java Project5  dir1 .*\.java .*public.*).

Pretty it can do the same thing as the example output can do.

Thanks.

I'm so stupid to remember the wrong due date.. I promise that I had it in my computer before due date...
