You can use Up,Down,Left,Right to control the little robot, and you can also click the Start Movement Button to make it move itself or you can click one more robot Button to add one more robot.
The mechanism inside is createElement and removeElement in the left and top of the robot to cotrol its location. And checking childNodes.length is to check bound. ReportNode() is I want to report how long the robot move with this function. Random Movement is just generate random number to give robot random instruction. And another thing I want to mention is the keyboard event because there is difference in firefox and IE, so document.all is only considered by IE. setInterval just generate the date and change pictures ceaselessly in the downside of the webpage.
I use the same color as my assignment 1, because I like the color very much. I also use DIV+CSS to layout my webpage.
