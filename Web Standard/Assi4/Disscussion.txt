This schema is built for resume data collection. The highest level element, "resume", is composed of several main parts (elements) including basicInformation, educationInformation, workingExperience, skills and honors. Application ID is set as an attribute required for the "resume" element. Each sub-elements of "resume" is also composed of a bunch of elements and attributes. For "basicInformation", "educationInformation" , "workExprience" and "honors", a complexType is refered to include all the elements and attributes, while for "skills", an inner complexType is defined within the element. SimpleType and defined datatype are used for the restriction of elements and attributes, such as string, int, date, range and so on. Also, for the education and workingExperiance part, minOccur is used to confine the lower limit of number of appearance and allow multiple occurance.
Overall, this schema is written to serve as a format of resume in xml form.
