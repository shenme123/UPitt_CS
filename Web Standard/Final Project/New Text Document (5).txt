Our project is based on several standards: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, linked data and PHP.HTML and CSS are the fundamental technologies for building Web pages: HTML for structure, CSS for style and layout.PHP is a server side scripting language. PHP files are just like HTML files, but they can include both HTML and PHP code. Web server parses PHP code when the page is accessed and the resulting output is written as HTML within the Web page. When a user accesses a PHP page, his Web browser only gets sent the HTML code, since the Web server has processed the PHP code in the background.
